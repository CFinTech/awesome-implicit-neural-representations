## Motivation

**I**mplicit **N**eural **R**epresentations **(INR)** have long been an intriguing topic, and in recent years, several classic works on implicit neural representations have emerged. However, there has been a lack of a comprehensive repository to organize these works. Some similar repositories stopped updating in recent years, leaving the latest papers on implicit neural representations uncollected. Therefore, I have created this repository with the hope of organizing the development trajectory of this field as I read through the latest papers.
